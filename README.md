Byte is a sequence of bytes of data. 
Data can be audio, video, text etc ... Here the code is for converting String in to byte array. 
While converting the String, each character in the String is converted in to ASCII code. 
This includes the spaces as well. Using Byte Array we can convert any datatype in to bytes, So byte array can be used to store different datatypes.

This code is for converting byte array in to String.
I have used String object for converting byte array into String.
